# Bowling Scorer

The solution to a coding challenge about calculating the score of a bowling game.

* Call `bowlingGame.roll(x)` where `x` is the number of pins struck down
* Call `bowlingGame.score()` to access current score
* Call `bowlingGame.scoreCard()` to see a record of rolls

Or, run `./gradlew build` and `java -jar build/libs/dius-bowling-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to see a sample game run.
